### Type: On-board Items

These items are not carried into battle by a specific crew member. Instead, they are usually left behind on the ship, and used at other points of the campaign turn.
# Loaded Dice

Each campaign turn, one crew member may gamble on the side. Roll 1D6. On a 1-4, earn that many credits. On a 5, earn nothing. On a 6, the locals donâ€™t take kindly to losing: The dice are lost and the crew member must roll on the post-battle Injury Table.
