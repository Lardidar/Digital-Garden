# Reinforced

Remove half the enemy figures from the table. At the end of each round, roll 1D6:

- If the roll is equal to or below the round number just played, the removed figures arrive from the center of the enemy battlefield edge. The arriving reinforcements are accompanied by two additional basic enemies.

If the table has no enemies on it after a reinforcement roll is made, the mission ends.
