Roll on this table to determine what actions you need to take to end the mission, once the objectives are completed. 

If you have cleared the table of enemies, you can leave the battlefield without needing to play every round in order.

| Roll | Extraction |
|------|------------|
| 01-30 | The mission ends immediately. |
| 31-50 | You must exit across any battlefield edge. |
| 51-70 | You must exit across any battlefield edge within the next 3 rounds, or you will fail the mission. |
| 71-85 | You must exit across the battlefield edge you arrived from. |
| 86-100 | 4 additional basic enemies arrive from the opposing battlefield edge. The mission ends when all figures exit across any battlefield edge OR after 3 game turns. |
