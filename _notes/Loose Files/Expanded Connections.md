**Checking for Connections**

- **Opportunity Missions Only:** Check for Connections anytime you determine that you will be playing an Opportunity mission.
- **Roll 1D6:** On a roll of 5 or 6, the mission has a Connection.
- **Connections do not occur during Quest, Rival, or Patron missions.**

Roll 1D6 and use the Expanded Connections table below (and resulting subtable) to determine the nature of the Connection:

> [!1–2 A person we have met.]-
> 
> - **1*: An old friend is in trouble and needs to be saved.**
>   - The enemy is generated from the [[Criminal Elements]] table. You will play out the Assault objective.
>   - If you fail or decline the mission, your friend gets killed, causing the loss of 1 story point.
>   - If you succeed, the enemy automatically becomes a Rival, but you may roll up a new character, as your friend decides to join you.
> 
> - **2: An associate gave you the location of a suspected data cache.**
>   - Play an illegal Salvage Job. If you Investigate all Points of Interest, add 2 Quest Rumours.
> 
> - **3*: Someone you’ve worked for in the past has reached out to collect on a favour owed.**
>   - The job will use the Patron Mission Objectives table, and any objective must be achieved in 6 rounds.
>   - The enemy will be accompanied by 1 additional Specialist.
>   - If you achieve the job successfully, your contact pays you 2 additional credits. You may choose to turn the job down.
> 
> - **4: You got a cryptic message from a friend who has gotten in over their head.**
>   - Set up the scenario (with a Fight Off objective) against an enemy from the [[Criminal Elements]] table.
>   - After setting up, randomly select a standard enemy that is actually your friend. They will move as per normal AI but will not attack the crew. If any crew member moves within 4” of them, they immediately switch sides and fight alongside you for the rest of the battle (counting as having a Reactions score of 1).
>   - If they survive the battle, or you manage to move them off the table-edge, claim +1 story point, and you can keep any weapons they carried.
> 
> - **5*: An old associate of yours wants payback on their former organization.**
>   - If you accept the job, set up an Eliminate objective against an enemy from the [[Hired Muscle]] enemy table.
>   - The enemy will have 2 additional basic troopers on the table.
>   - If you complete the mission, you receive one additional Loot roll.
>   - If the mission takes more than 5 rounds, you must add the enemy as a Rival as they have time to identify you.
> 
> - **6*: You received an “anonymous” tip that could only have come from one person.**
>   - This usually means trouble. If you agree to take the job on, play a Search objective. You will face 2 fewer enemies than normal, but at the end of Round 4, 1D6 additional enemies arrive from the centre of a randomly selected table edge. If 5 or 6 enemies arrive, 1 of them will be a specialist. The rest will be basic enemies.
>   - If you achieve the objective, you receive one additional Loot roll.

> [!3: A Place You’ve Been.]-
> 
> - **1* - Your research suggests that the location was hiding something of interest.**
>   - If you choose to go back, play out a Search mission against an enemy from the [[Hired Muscle]] table.
>   - The enemy is automatically accompanied by a [[Unique Individual]]. If you find the objective, gain 3 Quest Rumours immediately.
> 
> - **2* - A prior mission site has been overrun by critters, and you are worried the situation will escalate.**
>   - Roll on the Roving Threat table to determine what is crawling around.
>   - If you choose to go back, play a Defend mission and add +1 to the number encountered.
>   - If the mission fails or you decline, and it was an Invasion Threat, the world you are presently on is invaded automatically (even if you are no longer on the same world, they were using it as a staging ground for sector-wide attacks).
>   - If the mission fails or you decline and the enemy was not an Invasion Threat, all future Invasion rolls on this world are subject to a +1 modifier.
> 
> - **3* - Bad guys have set up in the ruins of the battle, and you could earn a few pennies turning them in.**
>   - If you take the offer, play an Eliminate mission against an enemy chosen from the [[Criminal Elements]] list. You receive +2 credits for completing the job.
> 
> - **4* - One of your crew (randomly select them) confides that they have a secret reason to go back.**
>   - If you indulge them, play an Acquire objective.
>   - If the crew member in question is the one to carry the item off the battlefield, they earn 3 XP and you receive 1 story point.
>   - Note that if the crew member in question is a Swift, they (and any other Swift crew) will go back without you if you do not agree to help. In this case, play out a separate mission using only those characters. They will receive no credits for the mission but receive +2 XP each.
> 
> - **5 - Just happens to be the same place… surely it’s just a coincidence, right?**
>   - Fight a [[Rival battle]] using the Ambush mission.
>   - Pick a random past Rival that has come back to take one more shot at you (literally!). If you have no past rivals, pick a current one or roll a random opponent (an enemy you made before the campaign started). The enemy brought 2 additional Specialists to this fight, and their Panic range is reduced by 1.
>   - If you walk out of here the winner, your captain earns +3 XP.
> 
> - **6* - The site is abandoned, but you suspect there may be some interesting bits to scavenge by now.**
>   - Play an illegal Salvage Job, against a Roving Threat. You may choose not to take the job.

>   - The enemy type you fought during the job becomes a Rival and immediately attacks you.
>   - The enemy is accompanied by an Enemy Boss from the [[Unique Individual]] table in addition to all normal numbers.
>   - If you kill the Boss, remove the Rival automatically; otherwise, they will follow the normal rules for Rivals.
> 
> - **2*: Employer kept your info in their cyber-dex.**
>   - Generate an objective from the Patron Mission Objectives table. You may roll on the Patron job Danger Pay and Benefits tables to see what they offer.

>   - If you want to stay safe, you can sell the intel instead, earning 3 credits.
> 
> - **5*: You receive a strange message referencing the job, and imploring you to meet up.**
>   - If you decide to go, play a Protect mission, but the VIP is a Corporate Slick. If they survive, and you complete the mission, your next campaign turn will be an Opportunity mission with a randomly generated Connection. If you complete your objective in the next mission, add +1 story point.
> 
> - **6*: The contact that gave you that job has dug up some dirt on their employer.**

>   - If you Rescue them, the Patron refuses to ever work with you again, but your grateful new contact gives you a Loot roll as they managed to grab a package on the way out. You may also add 1 story point.
>   - You can opt to turn down the job.
> 
> - **3*: A former Patron has need of you.**
>   - Pick a prior Patron, who offers you a job immediately. All details are rolled up normally.
> 
> - **4: You are not sure if you are being set up.**
>   - You will fight against the same enemy you fought last mission (if it was a Roving Threat, fight in the same location, but against a randomly determined enemy from the [[Hired Muscle]] table instead), but they are automatically accompanied by a Secret Agent [[Unique Individual]], and all Panic ranges are reduced by 1.
