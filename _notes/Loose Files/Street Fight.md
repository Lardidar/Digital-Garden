### Fire in the Streets

Combat in a street setting is a series of high-activity bursts followed by periods of ducking behind something and trying to see what is going on. A laser beam can come from any corner, and movement is often methodical and cautious to avoid stepping into an ambush. 

When playing a Street Fight scenario on the gaming table, we use an abstracted approach to time and space. Two figures in one location may trade shots representing only a few seconds of time, while another figure goes to investigate something and has a conversation with an informant. When they meet up, their time “catches up” and they are now acting together. Don’t over-analyse it too much, just think of it in film terms.

> [!City table setup]-
> You will need to mark off streets and alleys, though nothing stops you from having a shootout in a construction site or across a town plaza. Since filling a table with buildings is expensive (not to mention a bit difficult to game on), paper or card can be cut out to form building blocks and placed to form your streets and alleys.
> 
> You can make some buildings accessible by marking entrance points and then drawing in a few rooms. Don’t worry about making an entire city block detailed with all the apartments and shops. Just outline a room or two that characters can gain access to.
> 
> It is fine to leave some or all of the city blocks inaccessible as citizens would lock the doors when they hear trouble, but make sure there is plenty of ways in and out of locations. 
> 
> You will also need lots of incidental terrain to clutter up the streets and side alleys. Again, if you are on a budget, you can cut out paper squares and mark them as “tall” (blocks sight) or “short” (blocks movement but allows sight), and scatter them everywhere. 
> 
> Take a moment to determine what the buildings are: It can make all the difference to the narrative feel of the mission. If in doubt, roll D6 on the table below and apply the result to a block.
> 
> | D6  | BUILDING                         | EFFECT                                                                                |
> | --- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

> | 3-4 | Residential (apartments, houses) | No special effects                                                                    |
> | 5   | Warehouse                        | +1 Suspect marker                                                                     |
> | 6   | Abandoned or empty               | No special effects, but place plenty of difficult terrain and additional cover nearby |

## Visibility

Street scenes are chaotic and confusing as street clutter, passing crowds, and hover cars obscure vision. Of course, it is probably also raining dramatically in the neon-lit night scene. All visibility is limited to 9” in a Street Fight scenario, and cannot be increased by any abilities or equipment.

> [!Street fight miniatures setup]-
> ## Placing Suspect Markers
> 
> In a Street Fight, you must identify where the enemy is. All enemies begin the game as Suspect markers which may turn out to be opposition as you play. The mission begins with Suspect markers equal to the number of characters the player deploys. 
> 
> The markers are placed around the table, spaced out fairly evenly. Suspects should be along the side of the street, near shops or any other interesting features you may have noted. 
> 
> Place an additional Suspect marker by the entrance to any Warehouses on the map.
> 
> ### Determine Player Entry
> 
> In street fights, your crew is likely to have been undertaking various tasks and minor jobs and are now converging on their objective. Some may have followed leads or done research, while another may have stopped to get a neo-dog from a street vendor.
> 
> Each crew figure enters from a random point on the edge of the table. A direction die can be rolled in the centre of the table to determine each arrival. Place each figure at the edge of the table where the direction die points.
> 
> Your crew captain arrives last and may choose to arrive randomly or alongside any crew member already placed on the table.

> [!Encountering Suspects]-
> 
> Suspect markers behave randomly as their nature is not certain yet. It may be one of your opponents out to pick a fight, a random bystander moving suspiciously, or even a particularly noisy service bot.
> 
> #### Suspect Marker Actions
> 
> Suspect markers act in the Enemy Phase, after all active enemy figures have acted. They are moved in order from left to right on the gaming table. One at a time, roll a D6 and carry out the action shown on the table below:
> 
> | D6  | ACTION                 | RESULT                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
> | --- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | 1   | Stay                   | Remain in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
> | 2-4 | Move                   | Move 4” in a random direction, halting if unable to make the full move.                                                                                                                                                          |
> | 5   | Pursue                 | Move 4” towards the nearest crew member by the shortest route possible.                                                                                                                                                          |
> | 6   | Something Interesting? | The marker remains where it is. Place a City marker underneath it. This can only occur once per round. If multiple Suspect markers all roll a 6, the City marker is only placed the first time. Treat the rest as entry 1: Stay. |
> 
> #### Identifying Suspects
> 
> If a crew member ever finds themselves within line of sight and within a distance of 4+Savvy inches of a Suspect marker, the Suspect is identified; for example, a character with Savvy +1 spots at 5” range. Roll D6 immediately, and consult the table below. Note that this can happen both when a Suspect marker moves and when a crew figure moves. Halt the move at the earliest possible point it would meet the criteria, and resolve it immediately before completing the action of the crew figure if it was interrupted.
> 
> | D6 | SUSPECT RESULT                                                                                                      |
> |----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | 1  | Nothing Interesting Remove the marker.                                                                              |
> | 2  | Possible Enemy If the marker is in pursuit (see ‘Pursue’, above table), it is an enemy. Otherwise, it is nothing of interest. In either case, remove the marker. |
> | 3-5| Enemy Remove the marker and replace it with an enemy figure.                                                        |
> | 6  | Ambush Remove the marker and replace it with an enemy figure, then place a second enemy 6” away from the spotting crew member in a random direction. |
> 

> [!Street Fight Objectives]-
> Roll D100 on the table below to determine what you are getting paid to do.
> #### Individuals
> 
> Several missions involve an Individual. This character always uses the base character profile (Speed 4”, Toughness 3), and will not fight. They move at the end of the Enemy Actions phase and will wander in a random direction. If a figure within 6” and line of sight fires or is fired upon, they panic and immediately run a full move away from the incident and towards some sort of cover. They will then resume wandering at the end of each Enemy Action phase as normal.
> 
> A character within 3” and line of sight of an individual can corral them to move in a particular direction. This requires a roll of 1D6+Savvy, scoring a 5+. They will then move to a designated location within line of sight before resuming their wandering.
> 
> If used, Individuals begin the scenario in the centre of the table.
> 
> #### Packages
> 
> If a mission involves a Package, it costs 1” of movement to pick it up off the ground, place it in a location or hand it off. If a character becomes Down while carrying a Package, it drops at their feet. Roll D6; a roll of 1 indicates it is destroyed, making the mission a failure.
> 
> >[!01–10 - Contact individual]-
> >
> You must reach the individual and move within 1” to deliver the message. Once it is delivered, the individual is removed from the table, and the figure that delivered the message must survive the mission (meaning not permanently dead).
> 
> > [!11–20 - Locate individual]-
> >The individual does not begin on the table. Place 6 markers around the table in buildings or interesting locations, spread roughly evenly (use markers, dice, or other tokens that you can identify as ‘Individual markers’).
> >
> >Each time you move within 4” and Line of Sight of a marker, remove it and roll a D6. If the roll is equal to or below the number of markers removed so far (including the present one) you have located the individual.
> >
> > Finally, you must get the individual off a table edge without them becoming a casualty to save them.
> 
> > [!21–40 - Spy on individual]-
> You must end a total of 3 battle rounds with a figure within Line of Sight and 4-9” from the individual, then make your escape.
> >
> If the individual ever comes within 3” and Line of Sight, they panic and will flee towards the nearest table edge until they no longer have Line of Sight, at which point they resume wandering. You can resume surveillance after they resume wandering, but cannot do so while they are Panicked.
> 
> >[!41–60 - Confront individual]-
> >
> You must reach the individual and move within 2”. Once you do, roll 1D6:
> >
> >1-2: They are terrified and will attempt to flee, running towards the nearest table edge on each activation. You must defeat them in a Brawl (without claiming any weapon bonuses), at which point they surrender and are removed from play. The mission is completed.
> >
> >3-4: They want to make a fight of it. Roll on the Street Combatants Table (p.132) to see what they turn out to have been (they were obviously in disguise). You must turn them into a casualty to complete the mission.
> >
> >5-6: They must be threatened. Roll 1D6+Savvy, with a 6+ succeeding. You can try any time you have a character within 2”; the individual will continue to wander until you succeed, at which point they are removed from play and the mission is completed.
> 
> >[!61–75 - Rescue individual]-
> >
> >You must reach the individual and corral them. Once you have, once per battle round a crew member that is within 1” of the individual can move them in any direction desired.
> >
> >They do not move individually. If they spend an entire battle round with no crew figures within 6” at any point, they panic and will move to the nearest cover to sit tight.
> >
> >Once you have contacted the individual, the nearest Suspect marker will Pursue and enemies may attack the individual in Brawling combat (but not by firing).
> >
> >You must get the individual off a table edge to save them.
> 
> >[!76–90 - Deliver package]-
> >Select a crew member to carry the package. It must be delivered to the center of the table. No enemy or Suspect marker may be within 5” when the package is placed. You must then make your escape.
> >
> >Place an additional Suspect marker on the centre of the table.
> 
> >[!91–00 - Retrieve package]-
> >A package is placed in the centre of the table. Place a Suspect marker on top of the initial location. If the distance from the table edge to the centre is less than 15”, place a second Suspect marker 6” from the centre in a random direction.
> >
> >A character must move into contact with the package, and it must then be moved off any table edge.
> 

>[!Starting Trouble]-
>Any revealed enemies that are unable to spot any crew members after moving will try to start trouble.
>### Trouble Roll
>
> - **Roll 1D6**: On a 1, a Suspect marker is placed randomly 6” from their position.
> - Only one new marker can be placed each battle round regardless of how many 1s are rolled.

> [!Street Fight Enemies]-
> 
> The streets have their own ecosystem of gangs and bullies, always ready to challenge strangers invading their turf. Whether they’ve been hired or simply want to prove their dominance, the opposition in Street Fight scenarios can be varied.
> 
> Street Fight opposition typically does not have leadership as they do not operate as a cohesive unit. The same profile and armaments are used throughout the mission.
> 
> - **Opposition Determination**: The exact enemies are not determined until the first time you reveal an Enemy during the scenario.
> - **Profiles**: Some entries may resemble those on the main encounter tables, but use the profiles listed below specifically for Street Fight scenarios.
> 
> **It’s a Weird Place**
> Desperate times lead to unlikely allies. For a touch of variety, roll for a new type of enemy the second time you reveal an Enemy. Each subsequent reveal will then have an equal chance of being one type or the other.
> 
> Roll enemies on the Street Fight Enemy Table, however, If a City Marker reveal indicates that a combatant is present, roll on the Street Combatant Table instead.
> 
> **Morale**
> Morale is not checked during a Street Fight as the situation is too confusing and enemies may well be unaware of what is happening elsewhere on the table.

> [!Street Fight Enemy Table]-
> Use this enemy table when selecting opponents for a Street Fight scenario. Street Fight opposition does not generally have leadership as it doesn’t operate as a cohesive unit. The same profile and armaments are used throughout the mission.

> > Description: The unstable environment of a Fringe colony produces all manner of complicated belief systems, many of which end up producing militant squads roaming the streets.  
> > • At the end of each battle round roll a D6 for each Fanatic currently on the table. If one or more of the dice roll a 6, a single additional Fanatic shows up. Place the figure adjacent to the Fanatic currently closest to any of your crew.

> > • If a Terror member activates without a figure in sight, roll a D6. On a 1, they decide to blow up the nearest terrain feature or building. They move towards it each activation and try to enter (even if being fired upon, though they will shoot normally). If they activate within the terrain feature, a Bomb marker is placed, and a D6 roll is made each activation (including the present). On a 1-2, the bomb goes off. All figures in, on, or adjacent to the feature become casualties with no saving throw.  
> > • Once a bomb goes off, the Sirens! event triggers automatically.

> > • Neon Barbarians respect a well-spoken individual. A crew member moving within 4” can attempt a Savvy test. A 7+ means the Barbarians will ignore that character until the character attacks them.  
> > • Barbarians receive +1 Combat Skill versus any opponent that has fired a gun at them.  
> > • Note that any character carrying a sword of any kind will be challenged to fight, and cannot talk their way out of it. Blades, boarding sabres, glare swords, and ripper swords all count as swords.

> [!City Markers]-
> A city is a living, chaotic place, and this does not change while a gun battle rages. City markers represent the unpredictable aspect of a Street Fight scenario. The first time you play, you may wish to omit them to keep the scenario from being too complicated. Of course, you may be the type to jump right in!
>  
>  If in use, at the end of the Slow Actions phase roll 1D6. Note: Roll only once per turn, NOT for each individual marker.
>  
>  - **1-3: Nothing happens** – No change in the city’s state.
>  - **4-5: Movement** – Randomly select a City marker and move it 6” towards the table edge furthest away.
>  - **6: Something interesting** – Place a City marker adjacent to the terrain feature closest to the last crew member to act.
>  
>  City markers are ignored by Suspect markers and enemies.
>  
>  If a player figure moves within 4” (regardless of Line of Sight) of a City marker, immediately remove the marker and roll D100 to determine what you found.
>  
> > [!01–10 - Jostled]-
> > **Effect:** You get jostled by a rush of people.  
> > • The character must halt immediately and is Stunned if they were not already.

>  
> > [!11–15 - Curiosity]-
> > **Effect:** You notice something odd that seems like it was left behind.  
> > • Place a marker randomly 6” from the character. If it is picked up (by any character, not just the spotter), roll a D6:  
> >   1-4: Just some garbage.  
> >   5-6: Grants you 2 Quest Clues.
> 
> > [!16–30 - Informer]-
> > **Effect:** You encounter someone who has been trying to meet up.  
> > • Add a Quest Clue!
>  
> > [!31–40 - Crowd]-
> > **Effect:** There must be a sale on.  
> > • The crowd takes up a 4”x4” space and begins centered on the marker (which now counts as a Crowd marker).  
> > • Roll randomly to determine which way they are going. They will move 4” at the end of each Enemy Actions phase and blocks all Line of Sight. A character that ends up within the crowd must either stand still or move as the crowd moves, being carried along. They cannot take any actions while within the crowd. The crowd continues to move in the same direction. If they contact an obstacle they halt and turn to a random direction.  
> > • Firing on a character within Line of Sight of the crowd disperses them. It also immediately starts the Sirens! entry on this table. (No, you cannot deliberately fire on the crowd to disperse them. What kind of game do you think you are playing?)
>  
> > [!41–45 - Roadblock]-
> > **Effect:** You can’t get there from here.  
> >• An area 4”x4” centred on the marker is impassable and cannot be fired across.
>  
> > [!46–50 - Bot-struction]-
> > **Effect:** Construction bots descend on the area.  
> > • An area 4”x4” centred on the marker is taken up by the bots.  
> > • They will move randomly 4” at the end of each Enemy Actions phase.  
> > • The area cannot be moved or fired through. Characters caught in the construction zone at any point must roll 1D6+Savvy, requiring a 6+ to evade. Failures are handled by the construction bots and become casualties.
>  
> > [!51–55 - Reporter]-
> > **Effect:** A news reporter has shown up to report on “local color”.  
> > • Place a figure randomly 6” from the character that spotted the marker. The reporter moves 4” in a random direction at the end of each Enemy Actions phase. They cannot be fired upon or attacked in any way.  
> > • If, at any point, gunfire occurs within Line of Sight of the reporter, this starts the Sirens! entry on this table.  
> > • Additionally, if a crew member fires a weapon or initiates a Brawl while in sight of the reporter, you receive an Enforcer Rival. This does not apply if returning fire in a Shootout, however.
>  
> > [!56–70 - Street combatant]-
> > **Effect:** “Downtown is war”, as the Psych-Storm song goes.  
> > • Roll on the Street Combatant Table to see who has shown up. They set up at least 6” from the character in the closest location that puts them out of sight.
>  
> > [!71–75 - It’s a set-up!]-

> [!Messing with the Law]-
> If a character surrenders to the law, you can be in one of three situations. If you have a current Bounty Hunter or Vigilante Rival, you are at least a Level 2 Perpetrator. If you have an Enforcer Rival you are always a Level 3 perpetrator.
> ### Level 1 Perpetrator
> - If nobody in your crew has attacked the law officials in this scenario, the arrested character can make a 1D6+Savvy roll with a 6+, meaning they talk their way out of things. 
> - Failure means being detained for 1D6 campaign turns, with all their weapons other than those with the Pistol trait confiscated indefinitely.
> ### Level 2 Perpetrator
> - A member of your crew has attacked the law officials, but the surrendering character did not. A Savvy test of 8+ is required. 
> - If you fail, you are detained for 1D6+2 campaign turns. In addition, all weapons are confiscated, regardless of the outcome.
> ### Level 3 Perpetrator
> - If the surrendering character fired on the law officials, they are sent to a prison planet. They cannot be used again in this campaign. 
> - While detained, characters can take no actions or experience any events. They recover from injuries normally.
> ## New Campaigns
> When starting a new campaign, you may include one character that was previously sent to a prison planet. They bring with them their old profile, but will have been stripped of all equipment as well as Implants. They also bring with them 3 Enforcer Rivals!!
> - On the upside, you may add 1 story point, and they receive 3 XP for having survived the ordeal.

> [!The End Game]-
> You always have to move off the table to complete a Street Fight scenario. You may escape through any table edge. If a building has interior access and extends off the table, you can escape through the building interior as well.
> ### Payoffs
> - **Holding the Field** requires clearing all enemies and Suspect markers. Typically, you are better off just legging it.
> - All post-game resolution is handled normally as per the core rules.
