## Permanent Seizure

A warrant is out for your ship and they mean business. Every campaign turn, roll 2D6. On a 2-6, your ship is seized permanently by local authorities, and permanently lost.

You can cancel the warrant by decrease your outstanding loan value to 10 credits below the amount owed when the warrant was issued.

Rolling this status multiple times increases the seizure range by 1 each time (2-6, 2-7, and so on).
