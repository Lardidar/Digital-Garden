# Concealed

Remove the enemy forces from the table and divide them into three groups. Mark the 6 largest terrain features on the table from 1 to 6 (using tokens or dice). At the end of Rounds 2, 3, and 4, select a random terrain feature from those marked, and place one enemy group within the feature.
