## Reinforcements!

Two additional basic enemies arrive from a random battlefield edge (Roll 1D6: 1-2 left side, 3-4 right side, 5-6 enemy edge). Place them at the centre of the indicated battlefield edge. If the enemy has a base Combat Skill of +0, three enemies arrive instead, one of which will be a specialist.
