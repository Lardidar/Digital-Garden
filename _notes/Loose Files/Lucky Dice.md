### Type: On-board Items

These items are not carried into battle by a specific crew member. Instead, they are usually left behind on the ship, and used at other points of the campaign turn.
# Lucky Dice

Each campaign turn, one crew member may gamble on the side, earning +1 credit. If you have both Lucky and [[Loaded Dice]], you can use both, but rolling a 6 for the [[Loaded Dice]] means you lose both sets of dice.
