If you are fighting an [[Invasion battle]], you are simply here to survive. Otherwise, roll D100 to determine if a Notable Sight is present. Make sure to consult the correct column. The item is placed 2D6+2" in a random direction from the centre of the table, and can be acquired by moving into contact with it and foregoing any other actions that round.
