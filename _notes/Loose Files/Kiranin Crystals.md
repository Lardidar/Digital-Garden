### Type: Consumables 

Using a consumable item is a Free Action. A character using two in one round, must spend a combat action to do so. A character receives no benefits from consuming two of the same item in a single round. 

For simplicity, consumables are not carried by a specific character. If any are available in the Stash, any crew member may access them at any time. Bots and Soulless cannot use consumables.
# Kiranin Crystals

A bright, dazzling display of hypnotic lights will daze any character within 4‚Äù of the user, making them unable to act this round. The crystals have no effect on characters that already acted earlier in the round, and do not affect the user. A character that is attacked in Brawling combat will defend themselves normally.
