Gaming terrain can take a number of forms, based on their visual appearance, shape, and how figures interact with them. Many other game rules rely on how you have designated a piece of terrain. Terrain should fall into one of the following categories.

> [!Terrain type]-
> **Linear**
> Any long, wide feature that a miniature cannot generally be placed on top of.
> 
> **Individual**
> A single piece of terrain that a figure cannot climb.
> 
> **Area**
> Features that Cover a larger space on the table, which miniatures can be placed within. Area features block Line of Sight, and may be designated as Difficult terrain.
> 
> **Field**
> Similar to an Area feature, except that such terrain does not block Line of Sight. Field features may also be designated as Difficult or Impassable. Field terrain cannot provide Cover.
> 
> **Block**
> A terrain piece that can be climbed or otherwise interacted with, but which figures cannot enter into.
> 
> **Interior**
> An enclosed terrain piece that figures can enter.
> 
> **Interaction**
> Block and Linear features can generally be climbed. Area features can be entered, as can many Field features.
> 
> **Difficult**
> Some terrain features may be designated as Difficult terrain. This affects the speed at which figures can cross such terrain. Difficult terrain will consume an additional 1” of movement allowance for every full 2” moved in it. Difficult terrain includes features such as forest, swamp, rubble, and sand. Figures that fly may do so without reduced movement.
> 
> **Impassable**
> Impassable terrain cannot be crossed by any figure except when using flight, and for some terrain, you may declare that this too is not possible.

> [!Terrain Setup]-
> 
> 
> If you are building a standard set of terrain for yourself, the following combinations are suggested:
> 
> | TYPE   | 2X2 FEET | 2.5X2.5 FEET | 3X3 FEET |
> | ------ | -------- | ------------ | -------- |
> | Large  | 2        | 2            | 3        |
> | Small  | 6        | 7            | 8        |
> | Linear | 3        | 5            | 4        |
> 
> Additionally, apply the following guidelines to the features you construct or purchase:
> 
> - At least 2 features that can be climbed upon, such as structures or rocky outcroppings with natural platforms.
> - At least 1 feature that raises above the ground and offers elevated firing positions, such as a hill.
> - At least 1 feature that can be entered, such as a forest or cluster of rubble.
