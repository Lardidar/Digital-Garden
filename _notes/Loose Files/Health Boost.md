### Type: Implants

A character may have up to **2** implants. Once applied, they cannot be damaged or removed. Bots and Soulless cannot use implants.
## Health Boost

If a post-battle Injury would result in 2+ campaign turns of recovery time, reduce the time by 1. If the character has Toughness 3 when receiving this implant, raise it to 4.
