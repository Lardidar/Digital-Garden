### Type: Utility Device

Any character can carry up to 3 items from this list.

# Displacer

Usable once per mission instead of Moving. Aim anywhere in sight. The character teleports to a point 1D6” away in a random direction. If the teleport would end up within a solid obstacle, the device fails and must be Repaired before it can be used again. The character emerges on the same height as the aiming point, which may cause them to fall if they emerge in open air. The character may take a combat action after teleporting.

If used by a Precursor character, you may establish two “landing points”, and select to use either.
