### Type: On-board Items

These items are not carried into battle by a specific crew member. Instead, they are usually left behind on the ship, and used at other points of the campaign turn.
# Duplicator

Create a perfect copy of any one item in your inventory. A Duplicator cannot copy a Duplicator, due to the same proprietary nano-bot lock-out codes that makes your printer say itâ€™s out of ink after printing 17 pages. Single-use.
