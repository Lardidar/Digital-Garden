### Type: Consumables 

Using a consumable item is a Free Action. A character using two in one round, must spend a combat action to do so. A character receives no benefits from consuming two of the same item in a single round. 

For simplicity, consumables are not carried by a specific character. If any are available in the Stash, any crew member may access them at any time. Bots and Soulless cannot use consumables.
# Booster Pills

When taken, the character removes all stun markers. They may move at double normal Speed this round.
