Once the terrain is set up and looking good, randomly select which battlefield edge you will be entering from. The enemy is always assigned to the opposite edge.

- **For a 2-foot table:** Set up the enemy within 6” of their battlefield edge. Your crew will then arrive from the opposing battlefield edge in Round 1.
- **For a 3-foot table:** The enemy sets up within 9” of their battlefield edge. Your crew is then set up within 9” of your own battlefield edge.

- **Aggressive and Rampaging enemies** will set up in one “cluster” with 1” between each figure.
- **Tactical and Defensive enemies** set up divided evenly among 3 “teams”. Teams are placed 8” apart. Team members should be 1-2” apart, depending on terrain.
- **Cautious enemies** are set up in two “groups”, 6” apart. Members of those groups should be 1.5-2” apart.
- **Beast enemies** are set up in pairs. Divide the table into 3 roughly equal parts, and place one pair in each, evenly spaced. Each pair should have 2” between figures.

Any odd figure left over is set up on its own.

**Enemy Deployment Variables**
Set up both sides normally and Roll to Seize the Initiative. If you fail, roll D100 on the table below, using the AI type to calculate which deployment type the enemy will use. If you successfully Seize the Initiative, the enemy will always use the Line (i.e. standard) deployment option.

When placing figures arriving from Infiltrate or Concealment, they should be placed anywhere within or directly behind the feature that would permit them to fire on at least one crew member. Arriving enemies without ranged attacks should be placed as close to a crew member as possible within the feature.
