### Type: On-board Items

These items are not carried into battle by a specific crew member. Instead, they are usually left behind on the ship, and used at other points of the campaign turn.
# Sector Permit

Whenever you arrive at a planet where a license is required, roll 1D6. On a 4+, the Sector Permit is accepted. You must roll for each license type, on each planet.
