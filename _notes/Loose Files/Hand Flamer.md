## Hand Flamer

**Description**: Portable flame-throwing device with a broad focus for area effect.

| WEAPON     | RANGE | SHOTS | DAMAGE | TRAITS         |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Hand Flamer| 8”    | —     | 1      | Area, Burn     |

**Traits**:
- **Area**: Select a target point within range. Every figure within 2” of the target point is hit on an unmodified D6 roll of 4+ (5+ if partially obscured from the blast).
- **Burn**: Non-robot targets that are hit but survive will move a full move in a random direction. This does not apply to hits deflected by armor.
