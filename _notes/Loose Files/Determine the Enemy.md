> [!Number of Opponents]-
> The number of opponents you will face is affected by the campaign crew size you have chosen, by the size of your crew in the field, and by the campaign difficulty.
> 
> - For a campaign crew size of 6, roll two D6 and pick the higher result. This is the number of opponents.
> - If you opted to play the campaign with a crew size of 5, roll one D6 for the number of opponents.
> - If you opted to play with a crew size of 4, roll two D6 and select the lower result.
> 
> If the base number of enemies you would face is less than the number of characters in your crew, randomly select crew members to match enemy numbers. The enemy then adds their modifier number. It is assumed the missing crew members are at market, drinking or working on the ship
> 
> Add the modifier listed under Numbers in the Enemy Table. The modified total is the number of opposing figures you will be fighting. Modify this, based on the size of your crew in the field. If you are fielding a crew of 2 or more figures below the standard size for your campaign (typically 6), subtract 1 from the enemy numbers.
> 
> - If the campaign’s difficulty mode is Easy, and if the total number of opponents would be 5+ at this stage, remove 1 regular opponent.
> - If the campaign's difficulty mode is Challenging or above, and if either of the dice rolled a 1 or 2, reroll them before selecting the highest die.
> - If the campaign’s difficulty mode is Hardcore or Insanity, add +1 to the final number faced.

> [!Enemy Size and Composition]-
> 
> **Basic Enemies**
> - Armed with the basic weapon for their type.
>   
> **Specialists**
> - Armed with the specialist weapon for their type.
> - If Combat Skill is +0, increase it to +1.
> 
> **Lieutenant**
>  - Armed with the basic weapon for their type, plus a [[Blade]].
>  - Combat Skill is increased by +1.
>  - Fearless.
>  - If the character is normally armoured, increase their Armor saving throw by +1. Otherwise, add a 5+ Armor saving throw.
> 
> **Captain**
>  - Armed with the basic weapon for their type, plus a [[Ripper Sword]].
>  - Combat Skill is increased by +1.
>  - Fearless.
>  - If Toughness is less than 5, increase it to 5.
>  - If the character is normally armoured, increase their Armor saving throw by +1. Otherwise, add a 5+ Armor saving throw.
> 
> **Unique Individuals**
>  - If you outnumber the enemy, they are accompanied by a [[Unique Individual]] on a 7+.
>  - If you do not outnumber them, they are accompanied by a [[Unique Individual]] on a 9+.
>  - Add +1 if fighting opponents from the [[Interested Parties]] Subtable.
>  - For enemy types that cannot be accompanied by a [[Unique Individual]], the roll is still made. If it succeeds, a randomly selected enemy figure has their Combat Skill and Toughness both raised by +2 (to a maximum of Combat Skill +4, Toughness 6).
>  - If the figure has Guardian AI, it must be attached to a figure in the enemy force. This will always be the highest ranking enemy.

**[[Unique Individual]]**

> [!Enemy Psionics]-
> 
> If you have chosen to include Psionics in your campaign, you may choose to allow the enemy to include Psionics. Determine if an encounter features an enemy Psionic by going through the steps below in sequence:
> 
> 1. **Rogue Psionic**  
>    If you are facing a Rogue Psionic from the [[Unique Individual]] table, they are automatically a Psionic with two powers selected from the Enemy Psionic Power table below.
> 
> 2. **Swift or Precursor**  
>    If you are facing Swift or Precursors, a randomly selected enemy figure is automatically a Psionic with one power randomly determined from the Enemy Psionic Power table below.
> 
> 
> 4. **All Other Cases**  
>    Roll 1D6. On a result of 4+, a randomly selected enemy figure is a Psionic with 1 power selected from the Enemy Psionic Power table below.
> 
> Note that, other than the Rogue Psionic, no other [[Unique Individual]] can be a Psionic.
> 
> The selected figure replaces their normal armaments with a [[Handgun]] and [[Blade]]. If their Toughness would normally be 4 or lower, raise it by +1, as surviving wild Psionics are usually pretty rough around the edges.
> 
> All powers are rolled randomly on the table below. If the same power is rolled twice, the Psionic has only a single power.
> 
> > [!Enemy Psionic Powers]-
> > 
> > When facing an enemy Psionic, roll on the following table to determine their powers. Each Psionic will have one power unless specified otherwise.
> >

> > | 1        | Assail       | When the Psionic activates, select the closest crew figure in sight and roll 2D6. If the roll equals or exceeds the distance to the target in inches, the crew figure is pushed directly backwards 1D6” and is stunned. This may knock them off a ledge or into/through dangerous terrain.                                                                                                                                               |

> > | 5        | Direct       | When the Psionic activates, the closest allied figure visible to them will immediately fire if capable, receiving their full number of Shots. This does not prevent them from firing during their normal activation. If the Psionic is unable to see any allies, nothing happens.                                                                                                                                                            |
> > | 6        | Obscure      | Shots against the Psionic and any enemy within 4” of the Psionic require a natural 6 to hit. Shooters within 4” of the intended target are not affected by this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
> > | 7        | Dominate     | When the Psionic activates, the closest crew figure in sight is targeted. The target must roll 1D6+Savvy and score a 5+ to resist. If failed, the crew figure will immediately fire their full number of Shots at their closest visible ally. This does not affect their ability to act normally this round. If no allies are in sight of them, the crew figure is stunned instead. This power cannot affect Soulless or Bot characters. |
> > | 8        | Crush        | When the Psionic activates, the closest crew figure in sight takes a +0 Damage hit. If the attack fails to do damage or is stopped by Armor, it does not stun the target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

> > - Enemy Psionics using these rules do not suffer from Strain.
> > - While the Dominate power cannot affect Soulless or Bot characters, all other powers work normally.
> > - If the Psionic becomes a casualty, all effects cease immediately.
> > - Powers that take effect upon activation are resolved when the Psionic is selected for activation, but before they have moved or taken any actions.
