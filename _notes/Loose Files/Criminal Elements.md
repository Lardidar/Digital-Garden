You are facing some sort of outlawed enterprise or faction. When engaging any opponents from this list, there is an increased chance of a bounty being available. When setting up, roll 1D6. If the score is 1–3, that many bonus credits will be paid out if you Hold the Field after the battle.

Career criminals also tend to get even. When rolling to see if a defeated criminal group becomes a Rival, you must roll 2D6, with a 1 on either die indicating you’ve acquired them as Rivals. If both dice score a 1, they hate you. They become Rivals AND will increase the numbers encountered by +1 in all battles.
