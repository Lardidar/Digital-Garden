## Collectors, Fringe-style

An intergalactic collection agency is on your tail… and they have guns. Add a Rival to your list as per “[[Collection Squads]]”, below. 

Each time this result is obtained, another squad is added to your rivals list. They are treated as a normal Rival for all rules purposes. As they are often “free contractors” they will not stop hunting you, even if you do catch up on your payments. They must be dealt with like any other Rival. If they chase you down, you may pay them 10 credits to get them off your back and remove them from your roster.
