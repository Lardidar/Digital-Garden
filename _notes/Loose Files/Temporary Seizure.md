## Temporary Seizure

A warrant is out for your ship. Every campaign turn, when assessing ship interest roll 2D6. On a 2-5, your ship is seized by local authorities until it can be paid back to below Threshold 1. Interest will still accrue while the ship is impounded, unless the loan originator is Unity or a Sector Government.

Note down the amount of debt owed when the ship is seized. You must decrease your outstanding loan value to 10 credits below the amount owed at the time of seizure to get your ship back or cancel the outstanding warrant.

Rolling this status multiple times increases the seizure range by 1 each time (2-6, 2-7, and so on).
