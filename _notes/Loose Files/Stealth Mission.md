### Stealth Basics
In a Stealth Mission, your goal is to complete a special objective from the Stealth Mission Objectives table below. You must infiltrate the target location without being detected, navigating various security measures.
- **Detection**: If detected, the mission shifts to a regular battle. You'll need to complete the objective while managing incoming enemy forces.
### Table Setup
Stealth Missions require a dense table with plenty of terrain to enhance the stealth experience. Avoid large open spaces; the presence of numerous cover objects makes for a more engaging mission.

- **Play Area**: Stealth Missions assume a 3 x 3-foot play area (36 x 36”). For 2 x 2-foot tables, halve all distances and ranges.
- **Centre Feature**: Any terrain feature placed in the centre of the table should be something that can be climbed or entered, such as a building, forest, or ruin. Alternatively, you may leave the centre empty if preferred.

> [!Stealth Objectives and Exfiltration]-
> In Stealth missions, objectives are determined using the table below. Roll 1D100 to select your objective. Unless the objective must be located first, it will be placed in the exact centre of the table.
> 
> > [!Exfiltration]-
> > 
> > After achieving the objective, the crew must exit the battlefield. This can be done by moving across any table edge. Due to poor visibility conditions, it is easier to slip away. During each turn's initiative roll, you may select a crew member assigned a 6 and remove them from play; they have successfully exfiltrated and cannot return. This option can be used before the objective is completed.

> > | ----- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> > | 01-20 | Locate and Retrieve | An item must be located using the “Finding the Target” rules below. Once located, it must be picked up and then exfiltrated.                                                            |
> > | 21-35 | Deliver Item        | An item must be delivered to the objective. Select which crew member carries it. Once delivered, the crew can exfiltrate.                                                               |
> > | 36-50 | Locate and Contact  | An individual must be located using the “Finding the Target” rules below. Once located, you must move within 3” and line of sight, and then exfiltrate.                                 |
> > | 51-70 | Extract Individual  | An individual is placed at the objective. You must reach within 3” and line of sight of them, at which point they join your crew for the rest of the mission. You must exfiltrate them. |
> > | 71-85 | Transmit Message    | An individual is placed at the objective. You must reach within 3” and line of sight to deliver the message and get a reply (counts as your combat action), then exfiltrate.            |
> > | 86-00 | Extract Package     | An item is placed at the objective. It must be picked up and then exfiltrated.                                                                                                          |
> > 
> > #### Finding the Target
> > If the target must be located, follow these steps:
> > 1. **Mark Terrain Features**: Note any terrain features within 6” of the table centre. These features could contain the target. You may need to relocate some features to ensure at least three candidates, or place markers in an open area.
> > 2. **Search**: When a crew member moves within 6” and line of sight of a terrain feature or marker, roll 1D6+Savvy.
> >    - **6+**: The target is located. Place it within or on the feature (if possible), or adjacent otherwise, at the most distant point from the discovering figure.
> >    - **5 or Less**: The feature does not contain the target.
> > 3. **Final Feature**: Once down to the last possible feature, it will contain the target automatically.
> 
> > [!Items]-
> > - **Movement and Combat**: Carrying a mission item does not affect a character’s ability to move or fight.
> > - **Handing Off**: An item can be handed off during movement as a free action by moving within 1” of the recipient. Each item can only be handed off once per battle round.
> > - **Dropping Items**: If a character carrying an item becomes a casualty, the item is dropped where they fell and may be picked up by moving into contact.
> > - **Item Placement**: Enemies will ignore items on the ground and they are unaffected by other factors such as Area weapons. However, an item dropped in hazardous terrain (e.g., a pool of acid) is destroyed.
> 
> > [!Individuals]-
> > 
> > Generate the type of Individual using the table below. Regardless of title, the profile for all Individuals is:
> > 
> > - **REACTIONS**: 1
> > - **SPEED**: 4”
> > - **COMBAT SKILL**: +0
> > - **TOUGHNESS**: 4
> > - **SAVVY**: +1
> > 
> > **Movement and Behaviour**:
> > - Each Individual moves their base Speed in a random direction at the end of each Enemy Phase.
> > - Enemies will ignore Individuals normally as they are under strict orders not to harm them, or the Individual is fitted with stealth equipment or has psionic shielding.
> > - If third-party creatures such as vent crawlers are spawned during the mission, they WILL attack Individuals.
> > 
> > **Special Notes**:
> > - Individuals are unaware of any dangers they could stumble into and will halt at dangerous terrain features or environmental risks.
> > - Individuals are not armed. You can give them a weapon you are carrying, but once armed, they will be treated as a normal target by the enemy.
> > - If Individuals are caught by an Area weapon, they are struck normally. If they survive this or any other type of attack, they will Dash to the nearest terrain feature and hide there for the rest of the game.

> #### They Did What?
> - During a Rescue mission, if an Individual wanders off the table edge due to random movement, they are considered to have been Rescued, as they evidently managed to rescue themselves.
> - For other mission types, if an Individual wanders off the table, the mission fails. The Individual may escape, be picked up by enemy agents, or be eaten by vent crawlers, etc.

> [!Stealth Mission Enemies]-
> Enemy types are determined normally, with [[Roving Threats]] being treated as [[Hired Muscle]] instead. Enemies with Rampage AI should be rerolled (they’re a little too energetic to make viable guards).
> 
> [[Determine the Enemy]]
> ## Initial Enemy Figures
> - The number of initial enemy figures is not rolled for.
> - The enemy will always have a total number of figures equal to your campaign crew size +1.
> - This includes:
>   - **1 Specialist**
>   - **1 Lieutenant**
>   - The remaining figures are basic troops.
> ## Reinforcements
> - Any reinforcements will be basic troops.

> [!Stealth Setup]-
> ### Enemy arrival
> - **Placement**: Enemy forces are deployed evenly throughout the table.
> - **Elevated Terrain**: If possible, for every four enemies, one should be placed on a raised terrain feature such as a rooftop, walkway, or tower.
> 
> ### Player Arrival
> - **Arrival Edge**: The crew arrives from a single randomly selected table edge.
> - **Timing**: Crew members move onto the table in the first battle round.
## The Stealth Round
Until the alarm has been set off, each battle round is played as a Stealth round. Initiative dice are rolled and assigned as normal.

> [!Movement Rates During Stealth Rounds]-
>
> - **Quick Action Phase**: Base move +1”
> - **Slow Action Phase**: Base move -1”
> 
> ### Enemy Behaviour During Stealth Rounds
> 
> 1. **Enemy Scanning**:
>    - Randomly select one enemy figure to remain in place.
>    - This enemy scans in every direction.
>    - After scanning, the enemy faces in a random direction.
> 
> 2. **Enemy Movement**:
>    - Each remaining enemy figure moves in a random direction at their base move -1”.
>    - Each enemy faces in the direction they move each turn.
>    - Note: These enemies do not "pan" their viewpoint when they turn to move in a new direction. They are assumed to only look in the direction they are moving, regardless of their original position.
> 
> 3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
>    - If an enemy would move into a wall, terrain feature, or the table edge, they will remain in place instead of moving.
>    - The enemy scans in every direction and then turns to face directly away from the obstacle in question.

> [!Attacking While in Stealth]-
>
> A crew member may attack during a Stealth Mission by either moving into Brawling combat or by firing a weapon.
> 
> ### Stealth Attack Bonus
> - **Attacking from Outside Field of Vision**: A crew member attacking from outside the field of vision of an enemy receives a +2 bonus to their shooting or Brawling combat roll.
> 
> ### Alarm Triggers
> Attacks will set off the alarm if:
> - **Weapon Type**: A weapon other than a [[handgun]] or [[needle rifle]] is fired.
> - **Attack Outcome**: The target of a shot or Brawling attack is not knocked out by the attack.
> - **Weapon Specifics**: A [[Ripper sword]] is used in Brawling combat.
> 
> ### Psionic Effects
> - **Targeting Enemies**: Any Psionic power targeting an enemy (e.g., Grab, Shock, Psionic Scare) will set off the alarm unless the enemy is removed from play as a result.
> - **Predict**: Can be used to roll twice for an enemy spotting roll.
> - **Shroud**: Acts as a terrain feature (-2 to spotting values), but does not block Line of Sight.

> [!Tools and Tricks]-
> 
> During Stealth rounds, you can use the following options. Each requires a crew member to remain stationary:
> 
> | **Option**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                               |
> |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | **Stay Down** | The character tries to be as discreet as possible. Until the character activates again, all spotting rolls against them are reduced by the character’s Savvy bonus, provided they are at least partially obscured by terrain. |
> | **Distraction** | Select an enemy within 6” and roll 1D6 + Savvy. On a 6+, the enemy turns immediately in the chosen direction. When next activated, they remain in place, looking in that direction, and take no other actions. If the roll is a natural 1, the enemy immediately turns to face the distracting crew member and makes a spotting roll. |
> | **Lure**       | The crew member tries to draw enemies towards their position. Every enemy within 8” immediately moves 1D6” towards the location of the crew member and then makes a spotting check. Each enemy moves individually, but a single spotting roll is made and applied to every enemy. |
> 

> [!Detection]-
> ## Detection
> The crew risks detection under the following circumstances:
> - While a crew member moves, if any part of the move lies within line of sight and the Field of Vision of an enemy.
> - If a crew member is within line of sight and Field of Vision at the end of an enemy move.
> - If a crew member is within line of sight when an enemy scans (remember, scanning is in every direction).
> 
> > [!Determining Detection]-
> > 
> > 1. **Roll for Detection**:
> >    - Roll 2D6 for the enemy in question.
> >    - Subtract 1 from the roll if the enemy is scanning.
> > 
> > 2. **Spotting Value**:
> >    - The result of the roll is the enemy's spotting value for that round.
> >    - Reduce the spotting value by 2 if the crew member is partially obscured by a terrain feature they are within or in contact with.
> >    - Reduce the spotting value by 1 for each intervening feature that would obscure visibility.
> > 
> > 3. **Measure Range**:
> >    - Measure the distance from the enemy to each exposed crew member. Round any fractions down to a whole inch (e.g., 6.3" becomes 6").
> > 
> > 4. **Determine Detection**:
> >    - **Spotted**: If the spotting value exceeds the distance to any visible crew member, they are spotted, and the alarm is raised immediately. See "Alarm!" below.
> >    - **Suspicious**: If the spotting value equals the distance to any crew member, but none are spotted, the enemy is suspicious. They immediately move 1” towards the crew member in question, facing them, and roll again. The enemy is not considered to be scanning during this movement. If two crew members are at the same distance, move towards one of them at random. This process can occur multiple times.
> >    - **Unnoticed**: If the spotting value is below the distance to every crew member at risk, none are spotted.
> 
## Alarm Phase!

> [!Alarm and Reinforcement]-
> ## Alarm!
> 
> When the alarm goes off:
> 
> 1. **End of Stealth Round**: The current Stealth round ends immediately.
> 2. **Transition to Combat**: The game transitions to normal combat. Begin a new battle round as usual.
> 3. **Incomplete Actions**: If the alarm is raised before completing a Stealth round, end the round without completing any missing actions.
> 
> ### Reinforcements
> 
> 1. **Table Edge**: Randomly select a table edge from which the enemy reinforcements will arrive.
> 2. **Reinforcement Roll**: At the beginning of each battle round, roll 2D6.
>    - For each die showing a 6, a basic enemy arrives as reinforcements at the centre of the selected enemy table edge.
>    - Arriving enemies are placed immediately but cannot take any actions in the battle round in which they arrive.
