### Type: Gun Sight

Items from this list must be fitted to a non-melee, non-single shot weapon. Sights can be fitted to a weapon or moved to a new one when equipment is being assigned during the campaign turn. During battle, Sights cannot be attached or removed. If the weapon is damaged, any Sight attached also becomes damaged. A weapon can have only one Sight at a time.
