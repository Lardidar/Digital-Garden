An intergalactic collection agency is now on your tail. Every campaign turn during ‘Upkeep and Ship Repairs’ you must roll 1D6+1: 

If the roll is equal to or below the number of campaign turns you have spent on the current world, they catch up with you, and you are assessed a fine of 3D6 credits. If you are unable to pay the fine in full immediately, it is added to your loan, and you must add a Bounty Hunter Rival to your roster immediately. Either way, you may then delete the Collectors from your list of problems. 

Note that you can have multiple Collectors chasing you at the same time, with multiple potential fines.
