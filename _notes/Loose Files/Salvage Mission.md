> [!Salvage Mission]-
> 
> > [!What is Salvage?]-
> > As defined by Unity law, if a ship is drifting in space and lacking a crew, it can be considered 'salvage'. Properly licensed salvage operators may board the ship and strip it for valuables, provided all navigation data-files are handed over to the relevant authorities. In addition, the salvage team must de-orbit or detonate the ship if it is likely to provide a hazard.
> > 
> > Salvage teams typically also conduct more conventional “treasure hunt” operations. Crashed surface wrecks and abandoned industrial facilities are home to interesting scraps of tech to those without qualms about stepping over a few shrivelled corpses in the process.
> 
> > [!Requirements]-
> > You will need markers to indicate the following:
> > 
> > - **Contacts**: Likely opposition during the scenario. You will need around 10 of these.
> > - **Salvage**: Valuable scrap. 6 markers should be plenty.
> > - **Points of Interest**: Things you need to investigate. You will need 6 of these.
> > ### Using Salvage with other rules
> > 
> >**Elite-level Enemies** can be used normally.
> > ### Space requirements
> > 
> > Salvage missions can become cramped on a 2x2 table. 3x3 feet is recommended, and if this is not an option, consider reducing all movement distances by 1”.
> 
> > [!Illegal Jobs]-
> > 
> > Carrying out an illegal job means a chance of getting in trouble with the law. When rolling for post-game rivals, roll 1D6:
> > 
> > - On a 1-4, you got away with it.
> > - On a 5-6, the authorities are on your trail, and you must do ONE of the following:
> >   - Pay a fine equal to the die roll in credits.
> >   - Hand over all Salvage units obtained during the job.
> >   - Add an Enforcer Rival.
> 
> > [!Setting Up to Play Your Mission]-
> > The steps for a conventional battle are not taken, follow the steps below
> > #### Table Setup
> > The table can be set up using interior floor plans, but could also take place in a ruined colony, wrecked industrial site, or abandoned cave complex that used to be inhabited by something. If using floor plans, make sure there are exits towards each battlefield edge.
> > #### Place Salvage Markers
> > Place 1D3+1 Salvage markers around the table, spread as evenly as possible. These represent valuable bits of electronics, mineral deposits, or other interesting snippets. Any crew member can pick up Salvage simply by moving into contact with the marker. When they do so, set the marker aside: the crew has gained 1 Salvage unit. A Salvage unit does not have to be carried around by a specific character, and cannot be lost during the game.
> > #### Place Points of Interest
> > Place 1 Point of Interest marker close to the centre of each battlefield quarter. These represent areas that showed up on your ship scanners as being potentially interesting. You will need to investigate all four to complete the mission.
> > #### Deploying
> > 1. Randomly select a battlefield edge.
> > 2. Split your crew into two groups that are as equal in size as possible. Each group is placed anywhere you like along the selected edge, provided:
> >    - All figures are within 2” of the battlefield edge.
> >    - There is at least 10” between the two groups.
> > 
> > You are now ready to start playing. Note that you do not yet know what opposition you will be up against (or even if any opposition is present at all). There is no roll to Seize the Initiative.
> > ### Playing the Game
> > You must reveal all four Points of Interest, dealing with any problems you encounter enroute.
> 
> > [!The Exploration Round]-
> > If any Contacts or enemies are present, you will play a normal battle round. If there are no contacts or enemy figures on the board, the round is always considered an Exploration Round.
> > 
> > During Exploration rounds, a reaction roll is not made at the start of the round. Instead, your crew may move in any order you like. Crew cannot dash or use equipment during Exploration rounds.
> 
> > [!The Tension Track]-
> > Advancing through an old ruin or a dead ship is unpleasant: Anything could be lurking just out of sight, and the environment itself plays on the nerves, making the crew imagine threats behind every corner.
> > 
> > As you play, you will track the level of Tension, a measure of how likely you are to encounter difficulties.
> > 
> > At the end of the first round, Tension is set equal to half the crew size, rounded up. Keep a die next to the battlefield area or use a piece of scrap paper to keep track. The higher the Tension level is, the larger the chance of encountering something.
> > 
> > At the beginning of each round, roll 1D6:
> > - **If the roll is above the Tension score**, raise Tension by +1.
> > - **If the roll is equal to or below Tension**, reduce Tension by the number on the D6 die roll, and a Contact is spawned.
> 
> > [!Contacts]-
> > Contacts represent a high probability of enemy presence, such as scanner fluctuations, the sound of equipment, voices echoing down spaceship hallways, and so forth. When a Contact is spawned, a Contact marker is placed according to the following rules:
> > 
> > - **Randomly select a crew member.**
> > - **Place a Contact marker** at the closest point to the selected crew member that is not within 6” or  of any crew member.
> > - **If multiple locations are equally suitable**, place the marker at the location that would be closest to a Point of Interest.
> > 
> > Contact markers are revealed and resolved if, at any point, they are either:
> > - **Within 6” and ** of a crew member, or
> > - **Within 3”** of a crew member.
> > 
> > When either condition occurs, roll 1D6 on the table below:
> >
> > | D6 | RESULT | CONTACT EFFECT |
> > |----|--------|----------------|
> > | 1  | “Beep, sir?” | It was nothing after all. Remove the Contact marker. |
> > | 2  | “Are you reading it right?” | Select a crew member who opines they have a bad feeling about this. Remove the Contact marker and modify Tension by +1. |
> > | 3-5 | “Hostiles!” | You have encountered hostile forces. Proceed to the Hostiles! section below. |
> > | 6  | “We’ve got movement all over the place!” | The scanner is going haywire. Remove the Contact marker, then spawn 2 new Contact markers near the crew member that triggered this result, as per the normal placement rules. |
> 
> > [!Hostiles!]-
> > 
> > If you encounter Hostiles for the first time, roll 1D100 to determine the type of enemy you will be fighting in this mission. Refer to the enemy table indicated by the result’s description to determine the type. The enemy will not be accompanied by any Unique Individuals.
> > 
> > As you play, track how many times you roll each Hostiles! result and mark this next to the Tension track.
> > 
> > #### D100 Hostiles! Results
> > 
> > | D100 Result | Hostiles! Description | Notes |
> > |-------------|------------------------|-------|
> > | 01-25       | **Free for All!**      | Looters, renegades, or other suspicious characters are roaming around. Determine a random opponent type from the [[Criminal Elements]] table. Enemies within one move of a Salvage marker must move into contact with it; then remove both the marker and the enemy figure from the battlefield. |
> > | 26-40       | **Toughs**             | Someone hired a bunch of goons to make sure nobody snoops around. Determine a random opponent type from the [[Hired Muscle]] table. Any foe with Defensive or Cautious AI is changed to Tactical. |
> > | 41-65       | **Rival Team**         | Another team has taken an interest in your site. Determine a random opponent type from the [[Interested Parties]] table. The enemies will fight normally, but reduce their Panic range by 1 (1-3 becomes 1-2, 1-2 becomes 1, 1 becomes Fearless). |
> > | 66-100      | **Infestation**        | This is the worst type of job. Determine a random opponent type from the [[Roving Threats]] table. Modify Tension by +6. |
> > 
> > #### Number of Enemies
> > 
> > Consult the table below to determine how many foes are placed based on the number of times you have rolled the Hostiles! result during this mission.
> > 
> > | Encounter Number | Enemy Forces |
> > |------------------|--------------|
> > | 1st              | 2 basic enemies. |
> > | 2nd              | 2 basic enemies, 1 specialist. |
> > | 3rd              | 2 basic enemies, 1 lieutenant. |
> > | All Subsequent   | 2 basic enemies. |
> > 
> > Enemies should be placed in positions of cover possible) on or within 1” of the marker. Newly placed enemies cannot act during the round in which they are placed.
> 
> > [!Enemy Actions Phase Scanner Check]-
> > During the Enemy Actions phase, Contact markers that were on the table at the start of the round will move after all enemy forces have acted.
> > 
> > To move a Contact marker, follow these steps:
> > 
> > 1. **Roll Two D6:**
> >    - Roll two D6 in separate colours (or roll one at a time). The darker colour represents Aggression, and the lighter colour represents Chance.
> > 
> > 2. **Determine Movement:**
> >    - **Aggression Roll:** If the darker colour roll is highest, the marker moves this many inches towards the nearest crew figure.
> >    - **Chance Roll:** If the lighter colour roll is highest, the marker moves this many inches in a random direction.
> >    - **Equal Rolls:** If both dice show the same number, the marker remains in place.
> > 
> > 3. **Movement Rules:**
> >    - Contacts will move around terrain as needed.
> >    - They will halt their movement if they would cross the battlefield edge.
> > 
> > 4. **Detection and Action:**
> >    - If a moving marker would be detected, roll to resolve it immediately. During this resolution, enemy forces cannot take any actions for that round.
> 
> > [!Points of Interest]-
> > Points of Interest are investigated automatically when a character comes within 3” and line of sight of the marker. Roll D100 on the table below to determine the effect, then remove the Point of Interest marker from the game. 
> > 
> > **The Tension adjustment column lists the modifier to the current Tension score.**
> > 
> > | **D100 RESULT** | **REVEAL**               | **EFFECT**                                                                                                         | **TENSION ADJUSTMENT**                     |
> > |-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
> > | 01-05           | Obstacle                 | Acid, industrial waste, radiation or collapsing ceilings. A hazardous obstacle immediately extends 2” in every direction of the marker. This may affect nearby figures. All figures in the area take a Damage 0 hit that ignores any Screens worn. The area remains dangerous for the rest of the battle. Enemies will not voluntarily move into an obstacle. | Reduce by 2                               |
> > | 06-10           | Environmental threat      | Some old equipment that is falling apart and ready to spew something dangerous all over, unless you can just… The crew member makes a 1D6+Savvy test. On a 5+ they prevent the leak. Otherwise the crew member and all figures within 1D6” of them take a Damage 1 hit ignoring Screens. The danger does not remain. | Reduce by 1                               |
> > | 11-14           | Map readouts              | You find a local map that gives you a better idea of your surroundings. Randomly select a Point of Interest on the table, and move it 4” in any direction. | Reduce by 1                               |
> > | 15-19           | Secure device            | You find a secured lockbox of some sort. Place a marker indicating the box where the Point of Interest was. A crew member that moves into contact may make a 1D6+Savvy test. A roll of 5+ opens the box granting a Loot roll (usable immediately). | No immediate modifier. Each failed attempt to open increases Tension by 1. |
> > | 20-23           | The air is thick in here  | You keep thinking you heard something.                                                                                  | Increase by 3                             |
> > | 24-28           | Dead spacer              | Whoever this was, they didn’t make it. Roll once on the Loot table to see if there is any useful kit left. You may use anything you find immediately. | Increase by 1                             |
> > | 29-32           | We need to hurry         | Best not to linger in a place like this. Increase by 1 for each remaining Point of Interest.                        | Increase by 1 for each remaining Point of Interest |
> > | 33-36           | Dead end                 | There’s nothing here.                                                                                                  | Reduce by 1                               |
> > | 37-41           | Information station       | You find a computer, library, or diary that can shed some light into this place. Mark the item in the same location as the Point of Interest marker. A character in contact may make a 1D6+Savvy test to decipher it and receive the Tension reduction listed on the right. | Reduce Tension by the modified Savvy die roll |
> > | 42-46           | Hot find                  | You find some good salvage, but someone clearly came through here already. Receive 1D3 Salvage units.                  | Increase by 1 per Salvage unit just found |
> > | 47-50           | Survivors discovered      | Someone is alive here after all! Place 1D3 Hardened Colonists (core rulebook, p.172). They will fight alongside you for the rest of the mission. If at least one of them survives the mission or exits the battlefield, claim +1 story point. | Increase by 2                             |
> > | 51-54           | Hornets’ nest             | The scanner is suddenly beeping like crazy. Place a Contact marker near the revealing crew member.                      | Reduce by 2                               |
> > | 55-59           | Lure?                     | A dangerous find, but oh so tempting. Place a Contact marker randomly 6” from the crew member. When a crew member moves into contact with it, roll 1D6. On a 1-3, place Contact markers equal to the roll. On a 4-6, receive Salvage units equal to the roll. | Reduce by 1                               |
> > | 60-64           | All clear                 | This sector has been abandoned for some time.                                                                         | Reduce by 3                               |
> > | 65-68           | Incursion                 | The Converted are here! A 6 figure Converted Acquisition team, [[Roving Threats]] table: 4 basic, 1 specialist, 1 lieutenant) will arrive at the start of next round. They are placed at the centre of a random battlefield edge and will fight both sides. They can reveal Contacts the same way you can and are treated as hostiles by any existing enemies. They ignore Points of Interest. If you are already fighting Converted troops, you are in for an especially bad day, as these are simply reinforcements, and will join any existing foes to fight you. | Reduce by 3                               |
> > | 69-74           | Cache                     | You find a small pile of interesting-looking bits of scrap. Receive 1D3 Salvage units.                                      | No change                                  |
> > | 75-78           | Security bot              | You’ve found an old inactive security robo… oh wait! Oh no! The crew member makes a 1D6+Savvy test. On a 6+, you can shut down the robot before it activates. If this fails, place a Mk II Security Bot (core rulebook, p.107). The bot will happily shoot at both sides, moving first in each Enemy Action phase. On a natural 6, you manage to program the bot to fight on your side, though it remains AI controlled. (No, you can’t keep it afterwards.) | Reduce by 2                               |
> > | 79-82           | Creature                  | “Ow! Ow! Nice doggy! Ow!” A Sand Runner (core rulebook, p.107) hops out of its hiding place. Place it on the Point of Interest marker. The crew member may make a 1D6+Savvy test. On a 5+, the creature likes you and will fight on your side for the rest of the mission. It has a Reaction score of 3 (Bots and Soulless must modify the roll by -3. Swift by +1). If the roll fails, it is hostile and will attack both sides. | No change                                  |
> > | 83-85           | Rival trap                | It was all a set-up! Randomly select one of your Rivals. 6 of them (4 basic, 1 specialist, 1 lieutenant) will arrive from the centre of a random battlefield edge at the start of the next round. Remove all enemy figures and Contact markers. Tension is permanently set to 0 for the rest of the mission. If you have no Rivals, ignore this event, but increase Tension as indicated to the right. | Permanently set Tension to 0 if a Rival shows up. Increase by 3 otherwise. |
> > | 86-91           | Valuable find             | Sometimes it pays to look. You find goods worth 1D3+1 credits.                                                            | No change                                  |
> > | 92-96           | Interesting find          | This will need to be examined later. After the mission, you may make a Loot roll.                                        | No change                                  |
> > | 97-99           | Evac time                 | The entire site is unstable, collapsing or being filled with something bad. The danger area immediately extends into a 1” radius from where the Point of Interest was. At the end of every future round, it will extend 1D6” in every direction. Immediately remove all figures and Contact Markers caught in the danger zone as casualties, while Points of Interest caught in the area are destroyed. | Reduce by 10                               |
> > | 100             | Doomsday protocol         | You have uncovered something dreadful: A nano-swarm doomsday device intended to purge the site in case of an accident. Run! Place a Contact Marker at the location of the Point of Interest marker to represent the swarm. At the end of every future round, it moves 1D6” towards the nearest figure to it (crew, enemy, or Contact Marker). If it makes contact, the target is destroyed (crew become casualties), and another swarm is created and immediately moves as described above. The swarms cannot be destroyed or held at bay and no known defensive device protects against contact. | Reduce by 10
