### Type: On-board Items

These items are not carried into battle by a specific crew member. Instead, they are usually left behind on the ship, and used at other points of the campaign turn.
# Purifier

Each campaign turn, the Purifier can be used to generate clean water which can be sold off for 1 credit. This does not require a crew member to operate, but only one Purifier may be used at a time.
