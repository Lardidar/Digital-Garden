| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-60     | Generate a single objective. You must complete it to win the mission.                                  | No special notes                                                                                                                |

| 86-100    | Generate two objectives. You must complete one of them to win the mission.                             | You do not have to select in advance which objective you want to pursue, and there is no additional reward for completing both. |
> [!Specific objectives]-
> 
> > [!01–08 Access]-
> > You must reach a computer console in the exact centre of the battlefield. Once there, you must gain access. This requires a roll of 1D6+Savvy, scoring a 6+. A Combat Action is required for each attempt, but up to two characters can make the attempt every round. 
> > 
> > Soulless crew can attempt it while being within 6”. Engineer or Bot crew can add an extra +1 to the roll. 
> > 
> > Rolling a natural 1 means the system is hardened against intrusion. Rolling a second natural 1 for access during the battle means the mission is a failure, as the system locks up. Engineers (only) ignore any natural 1s. 
> > 
> > Once accessed, you Win the mission. If you drive off all enemies, you must nevertheless roll to gain access, but you can use any remaining crew member.
> 
> > [!09–15 Acquire]-
> > An item needed for the Quest is placed at the centre of the table. A crew member must move into contact, take a Combat Action, and then move off the table. 
> > 
> > If the carrier becomes a casualty, roll 1D6: On a 1, the item is destroyed. Otherwise it can be picked up by spending a Combat Action at the location they fell. 
> > 
> > If you drive off the enemy, you can pick up the item at your own leisure.
> 
> > [!16–20 Defend]-
> > Your objective is to drive off the enemy. To Win, you must Hold the Field.
> > • If the opposing AI is normally Cautious, Defensive, or Tactical, change it to Aggressive.
> > • Add +1 when determining the enemy numbers.
> 
> > [!21–28 Deliver]-
> > A crew member of your choosing is carrying a package. The package must be delivered to the exact centre of the table. A suitable marker or terrain feature should be placed there. Placing the package safely requires a Combat Action. 
> > 
> > If the carrier becomes a casualty, roll 1D6: On a 1, the item is destroyed. Otherwise it can be picked up by spending a Combat Action at the location they fell. 
> > 
> > If you drive off all enemies, you Win as long as the package is undamaged.
> 
> > [!29–34 Eliminate]-
> > Select a random enemy figure. They are the target. If they are killed, you Win the mission. If the target would Bail from the battle, put a marker next to them and leave them in place. For the next round, the target cannot move, but may shoot and fight normally. If you fail to kill them in this final round, they make good their escape, and the mission has failed.
> 
> > [!35–38 Fight off]-
> > There is no objective other than driving off the enemy. To Win, you must Hold the Field.
> 
> > [!39–45 Investigate]-
> > Place 6 markers, scattered evenly around the table. 
> > None should be within 6” of a table edge. 
> > When a crew member moves within 1” of a marker, remove it from the table, then roll 1D6. If the roll is equal or below the number of markers removed so far, the objective has been achieved.
> 
> > [!46–51 Move Through]-
> > You Win the mission if at least 2 crew members move off the opposing battlefield edge. If you drive off all enemies, you Win as long as you have at least 2 crew members remaining.
> 
> > [!52–57 Patrol]-
> > Tally up the number of large terrain features (or equivalent clustered features) on the table and, using a suitable die, select 3 of them at random. During the battle, a crew member must end a move within 2” of each feature. Once all 3 have been checked, you Win. If you drive off the enemy you can, of course, do this at your leisure.
> 
> > [!58–64 Protect]-
> > You will be accompanied by a VIP character (Reactions 1 / 4” / +0 / 3). They are unarmed and may never initiate a Brawl, but will defend normally. They cannot be given any equipment. The VIP must set up at least 12” from the centre of the table. The enemy must set up 12” from the centre on their side. Treat the VIP as another member of your crew. 
> > 
> > If the VIP spends a full round within 3” of the centre of the table, you Win. Ignore the reward for fast mission completion.
> 
> > [!65–71 Rescue]-
> > Place a figure randomly 1D6” from the centre of the table. They will be ignored by the enemy until you move a crew member within 1”. At that point, they are treated like the VIP in the Protect mission description, and will act immediately in the phase in which they are freed. 
> > 
> > They must reach a table edge to complete the mission.
> 
> > [!72–77 Secure]-
> > You must end 2 consecutive rounds with crew within 2” of the centre of the table. A crew member with an enemy within 6” of them does not count. Once this is achieved, you Win. If you drive off the opposition, you can complete the objective at your leisure.
> 
> > [!78–85 Search]-
> > Put a token on each medium or large terrain feature. A character in contact with, inside, or on the feature may search it as a Combat Action. Roll 1D6. A 5+ finds what you were looking for, and you Win. If the roll fails at every location, the item is not on the battlefield, and the mission cannot be Won. 
> > 
> > If you drive the enemy away, simply add up the remaining features and roll the dice all at once to see if the item was here.
> 
> > [!86–92 Sneak]-
> > Place the objective 1D6” from the centre of the table. To complete the mission, a crew member must begin their activation within 1” of the objective and not within Line of Sight of any enemy.
> 
> > [!93–100 Sweep]-
> > Place three objectives spread evenly throughout the table. None may be within 6” of a table edge. If a crew member begins an activation within 1” of an objective, and no enemies are within 4”, the objective is removed. Once all three objectives have been removed, the mission is a success.
