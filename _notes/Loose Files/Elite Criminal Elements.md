You are facing some sort of outlawed enterprise or faction.

- **Bounty pay**: When engaging any opponents from this list, there is an increased chance of a bounty being available. When setting up, roll 1D6. If the score is 1-3, that is the number of bonus credits paid out if you Hold the Field after the battle.
- **Gang feuds**: Career criminals also tend to get even. When rolling to see if a defeated criminal group becomes a Rival, you must roll 2D6, with a 1 on either die indicating that you have acquired them as Rivals. If both dice score a 1, they hate you; they become Rivals AND will increase the numbers encountered by +1 in all battles.
