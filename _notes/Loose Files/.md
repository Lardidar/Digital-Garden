**If you fought an opponent that isn’t a Rival and Held the Field**, roll 1D6. On a 1, the type of opponents you just fought become your [[Rivals]], and should be noted for this planet. On any other roll, they either had enough, or figured “business is business,” and will leave you alone.

**If you just fought against an existing Rival and Held the Field**, roll 1D6, adding +1 if you Tracked them down during Assign and Resolve Crew Tasks. Add +1 if you killed a Unique Individual or Lieutenant. On a 4 or better, they’ve had enough, and you can remove them from your [[Rivals]] list.

Skip this step for Invasion battles, or after fighting opponents from the Roving Threats Subtable.
