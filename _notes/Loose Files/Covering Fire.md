## Covering Fire

Select the enemy closest to your battlefield edge. They will move up to 3" to establish the best possible shot without leaving cover, then throw a [[Frakk grenade]] (if within 6") or fire their weapon (otherwise). If firing a weapon with only 1 shot per round, add +1 to the Hit roll.
