### Rival Attacks

If you are being attacked by a Rival, roll below to determine the circumstances. If you tracked them down, you will always fight a Showdown.

There is no Win condition against Rivals, but if you Hold the Field, you have an increased chance of permanently chasing them off. If you flee from the battle before 4 rounds are up, a random crew member will lose a random item of equipment carried in your flight.
