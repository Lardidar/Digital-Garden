## Regroup

Each enemy will make a standard bonus move. Each will attempt to move to the most distant position that is in cover, has line of sight to at least one crew member, and is in weapons range. If the enemy is currently outnumbered, place an additional basic enemy figure adjacent to a random enemy figure.
