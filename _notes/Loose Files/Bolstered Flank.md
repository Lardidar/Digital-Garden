# Bolstered Flank

Randomly select a neutral battlefield edge. The half of the enemy forces closest to this battlefield edge is removed from the table and set up near the centre of the selected battlefield edge. Generate one additional specialist enemy for the flanking force. No enemy may be set up closer than 12" to a crew figure.
