If you are defending against an Invasion battle, you are simply here to outlast the attacking forces as the war rages all around you. 

Invasion opponents always have two additional enemies. 

You must hold out for 6 rounds, then you can flee or fight until you Hold the Field. 

There is no Win condition. 

Any figure that leaves the table before Round 6 becomes a casualty.
