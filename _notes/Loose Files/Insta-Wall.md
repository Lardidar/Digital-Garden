# Insta-Wall

May be used once per mission as a combat action. Place a marker within 3”, then place a 2” long force wall oriented any way you like, as long as it touches the marker. The wall is man-height and impenetrable to attacks (but does not block sight or mental abilities). At the start of each subsequent round, a D6 is rolled. On a 6, the wall dissipates.
