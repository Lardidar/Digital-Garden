Your crew’s final piece of equipment is also their largest, their most valuable, and the most important for the adventure: The Ship. Roll once on the table below to determine what your starting ship is. Note that not all vessels are created equal, and sometimes you have to make do with what you could lay your hands on.

> >The base value of the loan will be the cost of the ship in question. Whether during character creation or a loan taken during play, the following adjustments are made:

> > When someone comes to seize your ship, you can choose to fight it out: 
> > 
> > - Set up a battle against Enforcers, adding +2 basic enemies to their number. 
> > - Set up in the centre of the table, at least 12” from a table edge. The enemy arrives from two randomly selected battlefield edges, with their forces split evenly between the two edges.
> > - Then randomly determine which table edge you must escape across.
> > - If at least one crew member escapes the battle, you can leave off-world. The warrant remains in place, and an Enforcer Rival is added to your roster.

> [!Ship Damage]-
> Ships can sustain damage through various events. This is tracked in Hull Points. Damage is never sustained to specific parts, regardless of the source.
> 
> **Damage Threshold**: Each ship has a damage threshold established when you began the campaign or purchased the ship. Once that amount of damage has been accumulated, the ship is a wreck and no longer usable.
> 
> **In Space**: If this happens in space, you crash on a nearby planet using the rules in the “Being Without a Ship” section below.
> 
> **On the Ground**: If this happens on the ground, you can reclaim 1D6+5 credits’ worth of scrap parts.
> 
> **Travel Restrictions**: If a ship has Hull Point damage, it cannot safely leave for another planet, prohibiting you from traveling during the campaign turn. Even trivial drive damage can be catastrophic.
> 
> **Repairing Damage**: 
>   - Damage is repaired at a rate of 1 Hull Point per campaign turn.
>   - You can funnel credits into faster repairs: 1 credit pays off 1 Hull Point of damage, and any amount can be repaired this way during a campaign turn.

> [!Emergency Take-off]-
> If you insist on traveling while your ship is damaged, your ship suffers 3D6 Hull Points of damage as the drive vents super-heated plasma throughout the vessel.

> [!Being Without a Ship]-
> If your ship is destroyed while traveling, you manage to escape in a shuttle and land safely on a populated world, but your ship is gone. Additionally, you lose all credits and can only retain 2 items per crew member. Everything else is lost in deep space.
> 
> While you don’t have a ship, you can’t travel at will. On the other hand, nothing prevents you from remaining on a single planet for as long as you like.
> 
> Travel is also possible by purchasing passage on a commercial vessel. This costs 1 credit per crew member, and you cannot bring any packages or cargo you may have been offered as a reward for transporting.
> 
> While you lack a ship, you are limited to a Stash of 5 items. All items are considered to be of equal “size” for this purpose, though multiples of a single consumable are considered to be one item.

> [!Getting a New Ship]-
> Acquiring a new ship is not cheap at all. 
> 
> Roll once on the Ship Details to see the ship on offer. If needed you can take out a new loan to pay for this ship but any remaining loan amount from your previous ship will be added to the price of this new loan as the new benefactor purchases your dept. Roll fresh on the Interest Rates table. 
> 
> You may opt to pass and look for a new ship each campaign turn.

> [!Upgrading your ship]-
> ## Acquiring Components
> 
> During the “Purchase items” stage of the campaign turn you may spend credits to obtain Ship Components. Only one Component can be added each turn. When purchased, the Component is fully functional at the beginning of the next campaign turn. 
> 
> You may have acquired Ships’ Parts with a certain value. These can be “cashed in” when installing a Component, reducing the cost by the value of the part.
> 
> ## Removing Components
> 
> If desired, during a campaign turn, you may remove a single Component from the ship. You can recoup 1 credit worth of scrap for every 5 credits’ cost of the installed Component. This can be done at any time, but you cannot remove and install a Component in the same campaign turn.
> 
> ## Fuel Costs
> 
> A ship with additional Components will require more fuel to travel. When traveling to a new Planet, the cost is increased by +1 credit for every 3 Components installed.

If you receive the Raided starship travel event, you may add +1 to the roll to avoid the battle. If you have to flee from a world that is being Invaded, you may add +1 to the roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If you roll the Navigation Trouble starship travel event, you do not have to subtract 1 story point. If you roll the Travel-Time Starship Travel event, you may receive the benefits of both that event AND Uneventful Trip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If you receive the Patrol Ship starship travel event, you only have to roll once for confiscated items. Each time you travel to a new Planet, you may roll 3D6. Discard any dice that do not score a 1 or 2, then receive credits equal to the sum of the dice that did not get discarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
> | Suspension Pod             | 15                     | Standard for non-jump travel. When managing Upkeep, you may opt to Suspend any crew members. They do not participate in any events, cannot undertake tasks or go on missions, do not recover from Injuries, and do not require Upkeep. While Suspended, the character doesn’t count as part of the crew. You can have up to 4 crew members Suspended at any one time. During any Upkeep step of a future campaign turn, you can revive any Suspended crew. They must be counted as part of your crew during the Upkeep step of that campaign turn, and will act normally thereafter. Any Injuries must still be recovered from normally after revival. |
> | Living Quarters            | 15                     | Improved living quarters for improved comforts, as well as more efficient life support systems.
