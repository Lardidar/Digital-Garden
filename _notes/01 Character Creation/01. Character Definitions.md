>[!Ability Scores]-
> Each of your characters is rated in five ability scores, which you can record on a sheet of paper, or on the Crew Log at the back of these rules.
> 
> - **Reactions:** Used to determine when a character can act during a battle round.
> - **Speed:** How far you can move in tabletop inches.
> - **Combat Skill:** Added to all attack dice rolls.
> - **Toughness:** The number that enemies have to roll above if they want to damage you.
> - **Savvy:** Covers technical aptitude, wits, and a bit of charm. It’s usually used away from the battlefield.
> 
> Next to each ability score below is listed the base starting value for a new character and the maximum possible for a Human player character. Depending on what happens to the character during character creation, some of these values may go up. Depending on what happens during the campaign, they might go down as well!

> [!Luck]-
> 
> A figure with Luck receives a Luck roll when they are hit. On a 4-6 the hit is negated and 1 point of Luck is used up. On a 1-3 the hit applies normally and Luck is not used up. This is done before making Saving Throws. Luck is restored after the end of the battle.
> ##### **Humans are the only species that are allowed more than one point of Luck.
