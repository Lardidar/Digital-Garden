> [!Selecting Your Crew]-
> There are four methods you may use to create your crew. We have included a step-by-step example of what character and crew creation might look like at the end of this section, and if you are eager to jump straight into the game, you can simply use the example crew. 
> ### First-timer Method
> If you are playing for the first time, keeping track of multiple characters can be confusing. If so, start with a crew of 6 Human characters, or use the example crew at the end of this chapter.
> ### Standard Method
> You receive 6 crew figures:
> - 3 are always Human.
> - 2 may be Human or a Primary Alien, according to your choice.
> - 1 may be a Human or Bot, according to your choice.
> 
> If you have opted for a reduced crew size, you may still select up to 1 Bot and 2 Primary Aliens.
> ### Miniatures Method
> Select 6 miniatures you would like to play with from your collection, then choose from the crew types below to match your selected miniature figures. You should still roll for the specific advances and background details as normal. This option allows you to have any combination of Primary Aliens, Bots, or Humans that matches your selected miniatures.
> ### Random Method
> You receive 6 crew figures. Roll on the Crew Type Tables below for each position. Under this method, each character is generated completely at random.

> [!Crew type table]-
> If using the random method, roll for the basic crew type first. If you roll Primary Alien or Strange Character, proceed to the relevant subtable, and roll for the exact type.
> 
> | Roll Range | Crew Type             |
> | ---------- | --------------------- |
> | 1-60       | Baseline Human        |
> | 61-80      | Primary Alien     |
> | 81-90      | Bot               |
> | 91-100     | Strange Character |
> 

> [!Baseline Human]-
> Baseline Human characters are plain, ordinary people. Distributed across thousands of worlds, cultures, and environments, their appearance, customs, and outlook on life can vary tremendously, but ultimately the baseline is Human, through and through. 
> 
> They begin the game with the following profile:
> 
> | Stat          | Value |
> |---------------|-------|
> | Reactions     | 1     |
> | Speed         | 4”    |
> | Combat Skill  | +0    |
> | Toughness     | 3     |
> | Savvy         | +0    |
> They have a single advantage: they are the only character type that can exceed 1 point of luck.

> [!Primary Aliens]-
> # 
> 
> These are the most common alien species found in crews around Fringe space. Note that, although many of these species can be encountered as enemies as well, any rules indicated here apply only to the player’s crew.
> 
> Proceed to roll once on each of the Background, Motivation, and Class Tables, applying the results from each. 
> 
> Some results may seem odd, but the type of character that wants to join an adventuring crew often has a rather weird, complex, or even conflicted personality. Soulless are programmed to emulate Human behaviour, and roll normally, while non-Humans tend to have the same institutions as Humanity, but are rather different in outlook or appearance.
>> [!01–10 Engineer]-
>> Slim humanoids with a fragile physique. They have an innate talent for interfacing with machinery, making them highly desirable crew companions.

> • If a K’Erin character begins their round within base movement speed of an enemy, they MUST move to engage them in Brawling combat.

>> [!41–50 Krag]-
>> ***Krag are a species of short, stocky humanoids. After their home-worlds were destroyed in a cataclysmic disaster, many fled, while other survivors have become expert asteroid miners, scraping out a living in the remnants of their home systems.*** 
>> 
>> ***They can be found throughout Fringe Space, either scouring for resources to send back to the Krag diaspora, or opting to abandon their doomed origins and embrace life as distant traders, mercenaries, bounty hunters, colonists, or more.**

> | Savvy         | +0    |
> **Special Abilities:** 
> • Due to their stocky nature, they cannot take Dash moves under any circumstances. 
> • Krag are famously belligerent and prone to getting into fights. When fighting rivals, Krag may reroll a natural 1 once on either the firing or brawl dice. The downside is that they often have a long chain of prior enemies. If the character creation rolls generate a Krag with one or more patrons, you must add one Rival to the list.

> >| Savvy        | +0    |
> >**Precursors have the following advantage:** 
> >Because their life-span supplies greater opportunity for past experience, if a Precursor is the subject of a Character Event, you may roll for 2 events and pick which one you prefer. If you would prefer avoiding the event altogether, you may do so by spending 1 story point after rolling twice.
> 
> > [!66–80 Skulker]-
> >Skulkers are rodent-like humanoids living at the edge of Unity-controlled space. While they only control a few systems, they have spread far and wide, particularly in the chaotic Fringe sectors. Skulkers are the only organic species known to have absolutely no concept of instinctual prejudice, making them an easy hire for space-faring missions where getting along in confined spaces is required.
> >
>> As their agility and flexibility allows them to squeeze into tight spots, they are popular as engineers and technicians on board starships. While they lack the brute force of the K’Erin, they also make for hardy soldiers, and Skulker gun-slingers, sharp-shooters and scavengers are a common sight in seedy bars on Fringe colonies.

> | Toughness     | 3     |
> | Savvy         | +1    |
> >
>> **Skulker characters are subject to the following special rules:** 
>> • Due to their agility, Skulkers do not suffer movement reductions due to difficult ground and are not subject to ground-based penalties such as mud, slippery ground or similar. 
> • Because of their peculiarly flexible skeletal structure, they can use all armour and equipment designed for playable species without significant adaptation, either by making a hole for their tail or by tucking their tail around their body. 
> • Skulkers have strong biological resistance. They are immune to any, toxin, virus, gas, or similar biological hazard, a Skulker may shrug off the effect on a D6 roll of 3+. During continued exposure, the roll must be made every round or for each instance of exposure. This protection applies to all hazards triggered by Points of Interest in a [[Salvage mission]]. Unfortunately, this also applies to any drug they are subjected to, including [[Booster Pills]], [[Combat Serum]], [[Rage Out]], and [[Tranquillity]]. Stim-packs work just fine, however, as these merely buff a Skulker’s inherent resistances.

>> • When firing a weapon with multiple shots, Swift must direct every shot at the same target.

> [!Bot]-
> Typical Bots are built to a bewildering array of configurations, but the profile given here will fit most combat, security, and multi-purpose Bots. They are fitted with emotion-simulation modules, allowing fairly complex “personalities”.
